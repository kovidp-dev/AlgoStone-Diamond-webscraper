
# Automated Diamond Information Scraper by StoneAlgo

## Project Overview
This project highlights the development of a robust web scraper tailored for extracting detailed information on over 4,000 diamonds from a specialized website. The successful completion of this project underscores the ability to deliver high-quality web scraping solutions capable of handling significant data volumes efficiently.

## Key Challenges
- **Complex Website Structure:** The targeted diamond website featured a complex structure with dynamic elements, necessitating meticulous navigation and data extraction strategies.
- **Large Data Volume:** Processing thousands of diamond details required an optimized approach to ensure timely completion.
- **Rate Limiting Concerns:** Potential rate limiting on the website side posed a challenge, requiring adjustments to the scraper's behavior to mitigate this issue.

# Installation Guide

1. Create a project environment within the designated folder:
   - For Windows: `python -m venv env`
   - For macOS: `virtualenv venv`

2. Activate the created environment:
   - For Windows: `.\env\Scripts\activate`
   - For macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. Install all required packages using the provided requirements file:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Execute the following command to initiate the diamond URL download:
   - `python main.py`

5. Enjoy utilizing the program! ðŸ«¡

## Technologies Utilized
- **Python:** Utilized as the primary programming language.
- **Selenium WebDriver:** Employed for programmatic browser control, enabling interaction with the website and dynamic data extraction.
- **pandas:** Leveraged for efficient organization and manipulation of the extracted diamond information.

## Speed Optimization Techniques
- **Multithreading:** Implemented multithreading using Python's ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently scrape multiple diamond pages, thereby significantly enhancing speed.
- **Efficient XPath Selectors:** Optimized XPath queries to precisely target the desired data elements, reducing unnecessary HTML parsing and enhancing performance.
- **Headless Mode:** Configured the scraper to operate in headless browser mode, thereby minimizing resource consumption and expediting execution.
- **Respectful Pauses (if applicable):** Incorporated strategic delays or adjusted request patterns, if necessary, to circumvent triggering the website's rate-limiting mechanisms.

## Results
- Successfully scraped detailed data for over 4,000 diamonds, furnishing the client with valuable insights.
- Achieved a substantial increase in scraping speed through the implementation of optimizations.
- Reduced scraping time by approximately 66% compared to the initial unoptimized version.

## Code Refactoring Status
- Code refactoring is currently in progress.
